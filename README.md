> ️⚠️ **WARNING:** USE THIS BOT IN YOUR OWN RISK, IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU GET BANNED BY YOUTUBE OR ANYTHING SIMILAR. THE BOT
WILL ONLY WORK WITH ONLY ONE IP ADDRESS, YOUR LOCAL IP ADDRESS.

This is the Minimal version of [YouTube View Bot](https://github.com/sryu1/YouTube_View_Bot)

To run the bot, first install the required packaged by using

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the bot

```console
python Bot.py
```


PLEASE NOTE that the watch time you have entered will apply to the last browser tab opened. For example, if you select 4
views and 2 tabs with a watch time of 2 minutes, both videos will refresh when the second video reaches 2 minutes so if
the video is 2:01 long, the first video might change videos, and it will refresh in a different video which you wouldn't
want happening.

When the bot opens new browser tabs, it will go from a range of different websites to the provided link. This is because
it can improve the video analytics of traffic history.
